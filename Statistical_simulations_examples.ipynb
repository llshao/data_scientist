    "# Python Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python, like other programming languages, has an abundance of additional modules or libraries that augument the base framework and functionality of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a library as a collection of functions that can be accessed to complete certain programming tasks without having to write your own algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we will focus primarily on the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numpy** is a library for working with arrays of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pandas** provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scipy** is a library of techniques for numerical and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Matplotlib** is a library for making graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Seaborn** is a higher-level interface to Matplotlib that can be used to simplify many graphing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Statsmodels** is a library that implements many statistical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliable and accesible documentation is an absolute necessity when it comes to knowledge transfer of programming languages.  Luckily, python provides a significant amount of detailed documentation that explains the ins and outs of the language syntax, libraries, and more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to read documentation is crucial for any programmer as it will serve as a fantastic resource when learning the intricacies of python.\n",
